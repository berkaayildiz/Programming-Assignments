# Programming Assignments

A repository contains a collection of completed programming assignments from various classes.

## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of programming assignments completed for various classes that I took at Ä°zmir Institute of Technology. 

All the assignments were given as a homework at that time. The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for students who are currently taking the same classes or similar classes. The assignments are organized by the class they were given for.

## Classes

The following is a list of classes that are included in this repository:

- [CENG113 - Programming Basics](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/courses/ceng-113/)
- [CENG112 - Data Structures](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/courses/ceng-112/)

## Contributing

While the assignments in this repository are already completed, you can still contribute by adding your own completed assignments if you done it with a different approach. This can help other students to understand the problem better and learn different ways to solve it. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch with an appropriate name for your contribution.

3. Add the completed assignment to the repository. Make sure to include the source code files, test cases, and any additional resources that were used during the assignment.

4. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.

5. Submit a pull request to the main repository, describing the assignment you are contributing and any additional details you think are relevant.

Once your pull request is reviewed and accepted, your completed assignment will be added to the repository.
